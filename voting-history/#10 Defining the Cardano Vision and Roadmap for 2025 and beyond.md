|Mesh Vote|âœ…YES|
|Rationale|We see the proposed roadmap  for 2025 as a helpful effort in building ecosystem wide alignment on top priorities, and vote Yes on this proposal. We also hope that this proposal will encourage other efforts which aim to propose further roadmaps for the Cardano ecosystem. Since we achieved the last of the initial Cardano Milestones with Voltaire, we think that longterm roadmaps at Cardano have proven their worth and value and are a existential part of our culture and careful longterm thinking |

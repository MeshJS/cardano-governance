|Rational|Plomin founder at Mehen was a outstanding contributor to the Cardano Ecosystem. His unexpected passing on November 14th, 2024 will leave a void at the Community. We lost one of our best. We endorse to pay tribute to Matthew and to honor his work and achievements. Lets keep his name alive.|

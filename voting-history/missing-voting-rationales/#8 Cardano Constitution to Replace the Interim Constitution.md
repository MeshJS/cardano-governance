|Proposal Title|[Cardano Constitution to Replace the Interim Constitution](https://adastat.net/governances/8c653ee5c9800e6d31e79b5a7f7d4400c81d44717ad4db633dc18d4c07e4a4fd00)|
|Governance Action ID|gov_action133jnaewfsq8x6v08ndd87l2yqryp63r30t2dkceacxx5cply5n7sqzlcyqf|
|Type|New constitution|
|Mesh Vote|âœ…YES|
|Rationale|We see the proposed Constitution as a major improvement to the currently active interim Constitution and feel confident that emerging governance infrastructure and capacities are in place and growing to build and act upon the new Constitution. However, while we respect the significant community engagement and involvement which has led to major improvements, we still see room for improvements at the proposed constitution and hope that further evolutions lead of a constantly evolving constitution which is able to reflect and support rapid ecosystem growth and changes |
